  Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of LOREM.COM. As the news spread amongst your partners, employees, and customers, your mobile is ringing for three days.<span class="emp"> You've got a huge number of calls,</span> a mailbox full of messages and congrats.

Increased trust, word of mouth, no traffic leaks, an important immunity against another brand who may grab the domain, better SEO and more effective marketing campaigns. You didn't even realize you were missing on all of those before
